# Reporting an issue

If you are willing to report a bug, Unity strongly recommends you to:

- Attach the `.abc` file that can reproduce the issue.

- Indicate which version of the package you are using (for example, 0.1.0-preview).

- Attach the `Editor.log` file (see [Log Files](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/LogFiles.html) in the Unity Manual for more details).
